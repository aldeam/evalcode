# evalcode
Moodle plugin for automated evaluation of academic source code.

The use of online learning and management systems
such as Moodle is constantly growing and it is
considered one of the preferred ways to communicate
teachers and students.

EvalCode is a tool for
the automatic evaluation of programming exercises
which is integrated in the Moodle platform. This tool
is able to evaluate the students' submissions and
generate feedback data for both students and teachers.

The use of this kind of systems helps teachers to
reduce the work associated with continuous
assessment and it is also able to provide students with
an immediate idea of the deficiencies found in their
exercise.

This plugin is currently under development and it will be available soon.

In its current version, the tool is capable of
evaluating both the functional behavior and the
quality of source code written in Java. This automatic
assessment system has been successfully used in
some lab exercises from the Data Structures course
(Degree in Computer Engineering).
